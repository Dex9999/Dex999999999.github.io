# What Was The Purpose Of Making This?

I made this to learn more about Shakespeare and to teach more people about him. Most people stay away from him because he lived long ago and they don't understand his language. I want to show that Shakespeare is awesome. I also want to make Shakespeare and other shows more fun.
