# What Was The Purpose Of Making This?

I made this to learn more about Shakespeare and to teach more people about him and theatre. Most people stay away from him because he lived long ago and they don't understand his language. I want to show that Shakespeare is awesome. I also want to make Shakespeare and other shows more fun. I will most likely make comics about his plays or a summary of his plays and other plays/musicals.
