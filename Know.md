# What I Know About Shakespere
[Back To Home](althome)
I recently watched Romeo and Juliet and read a book with a summary of each of Shakespeare's plays. This and a Shakespearean insult book I have has made me very interested in him. I now know a lot about his plays but all I know about him is that:
* He wrote 37 plays
* He was born in 1564
* He helped write a few other plays like Edward III
* He was great at using language to set the tone or scene
* His plays are performed in many different langauges around the world
* He also wrote a lot of sonnets
In this website I will do some research and learn more about the bard.
