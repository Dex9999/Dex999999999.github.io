# What I Learned

1. The main reason Shakespeare became famous is that he wrote great stories with complicated characters. Because the characters had positive and negative attributes they seemed much more humanlike. Also, he was very talented at writing poems. Even though his stories were not original and came from history or other writers, the way he presented the stories using these techniques made them much more interesting and fun to watch. Now, despite the fact his language is less understood he still dominates because of the genius of his plays.

2. He usually would collaborate with others when he was writing. Also when he was performing on stage he watched how the audience reacted to parts and how actors portrayed them. It is most likely that Shakespeare wrote most of his plays in a theatre or he could have written plays at a table in a London pub he seemed to like. The playwriting community would often help each other and saw a lot of each other and help each other a lot. Sadly because it was in the past we can never know for sure.

3. If you are measuring by what play most people know of then it is Romeo and Juliet with Hamlet and Macbeth coming in a close second. But the most performed play written by Shakespeare is A Midsummer Night's Dream. Here is a graph with the most performed Shakespeare plays:

4. In early London Shakespeare's most watched plays were the histories unlike now with more people watching the tragedies. But early readers didn't like Shakespeare as much as other playwriters like Ben Johnson (who you have probably never heard of) and it wasn't until the late 1700s, around 80 years after Hamlet was first performed that readers started to praise the "To be or not to be" speech. Also, he was originally popular as a poet for his sonnets and Venus and Adonis before being known for his plays.

5. Shakespeare's lost years refer to the seven years of his life where no records of him exist. There are many rumours about what he was doing during this time.  A theory is that he might have hidden for poaching game from the nearby landlord or he might have been an assistant to a schoolmaster in Lancashire. Sadly because there are no records, we will probably never know what he did during these years.
